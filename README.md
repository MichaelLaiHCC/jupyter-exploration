Name the repository "jupyter-exploration."
Initialize the repository with a README.
1.4 Make a First Commit (5 minutes):

Edit the README file to include a brief description of the lab session.
Commit the changes directly to the main branch.
Part 2: Installing and Using Jupyter Notebooks (35 minutes):
2.1 Installation (10 minutes):

Navigate to Anaconda Distribution (a free Python distribution that includes Jupyter Notebooks).
Download and install Anaconda (make sure to download the correct version for your operating system).
2.2 Launching Jupyter Notebook (5 minutes):

Name the notebook "My_First_Notebook."
2.4 Basic Operations in Jupyter Notebook (10 minutes):

Explain the concept of cells in a Jupyter Notebook (code cells, markdown cells).
Create and run a simple code cell (e.g., print("Hello, World!")).
Create and format a markdown cell (e.g., write a simple text like "My first markdown cell in Jupyter").
2.5 Saving and Sharing through GitHub (5 minutes):

Save the notebook.
Upload the notebook to the "jupyter-exploration" GitHub repository created earlier.
Submission Instruction
GitHub Repository Link:
Ensure that your Jupyter Notebook (My_First_Notebook.ipynb) is uploaded to your jupyter-exploration repository on GitHub.
Check that your repository is public so that it can be accessed and reviewed.
Submit the link to your GitHub repository. The link should be in the following format: https://github.com/[YourUsername]/jupyter-exploration.
2. One-Page Journal/Summary:
Prepare a one-page document reflecting on your lab experience. The document should be structured into three parts:

a. What You Did:

Briefly describe the steps you took during the lab session. Include setting up your GitHub account, creating a repository, installing Jupyter Notebook, and performing basic operations in the notebook.
b. What You Learned:

Reflect on the new concepts and tools you were introduced to in this lab. Discuss what you learned about version control with GitHub and interactive computing with Jupyter Notebooks.
Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
 Submit and save your work in a PDF or Word document named  L02_Submitter_Name_ITAI1378 replacing the italicized words with your name and last name .
